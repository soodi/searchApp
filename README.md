# searchApp

This is a single page app that allows users to search for financial institutions of their interest. When user enters some data the results will show in the same page in different table depends on the type of the financial institue.

I used jQuery library to access DOM and also to make ajax request and connect to json file. 
The page is very simple, the only part that change in smaller devices is padding left and right of list elements.

To run the app: just put files in the server and start the server and see the webpage
I use MAMP sever and I put the file in htdocs folder in the MAMP folder and then in the browser you can access the index file from localhost 
For example: http://http://localhost:8888/index.html

This app works on Chrome and Firefox
